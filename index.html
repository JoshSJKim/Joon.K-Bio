      <p id="summary">As you can see from the very generalized timeline of mine, I had no direction in life. Feeling like a boat without sails drifting aimlessly in the vast ocean.
      Aside from my hobbies (rock climbing and sketching), I didn't know what to do with my life. I always thought 'work will be work. It cannot be enjoyable'.<br>
      Until I casually asked a musician friend - who turned into a full-stack software engineer - about how to get in to coding.<br>
      He was more excited than I was at the fact that I took interest in coding and has been a tremendous help in getting things rolling.<br>
      I am still very overwhelmed at the vast amount of information that I need to process and learn. But I am enjoying the challenge. Eager to learn and grow.
