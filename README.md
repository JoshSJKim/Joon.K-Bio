# Joon.K-Bio

FCC certification project2

- The project is to create a tribute page.
- I decided to do a little bio about myself.
- This simple project consists of adding images, paragraphs, ul, etc.
- my personal goal is to properly utilize the @media query to create a responsive page with proper ratios and layouts based on the screen size.

- Having trouble adding image from local hard-drive.
- Not sure if it's even possible.
- Problem solved by using relative path rather than a full path.

- Still need to work on CSS, the real challenge
