# Joon.K-Bio

FCC certification project2

- The project is to create a tribute page.
- I decided to do a little bio about myself.
- This simple project consists of adding images, paragraphs, ul, etc.
- my personal goal is to properly utilize the @media query to create a responsive page with proper ratios and layouts based on the screen size.

- Having trouble adding image from local hard-drive.
- Not sure if it's even possible.
- Problem solved by using relative path rather than a full path.

- Still need to work on CSS, the real challenge

## Add link to use google font

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=[font_name]">```

- When using multiple font names, it should be separated by a '|'.
- If the font name has a space in it, use a '+' ('font+name') when adding font name to the link element
- If the font name has a space in it, use single quotes 'font name' when applying to CSS.
